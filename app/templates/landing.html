        <h1>Welcome to 2EITRAM2</h1>
        <p>
            2EITRAM2 is a privacy-focused browser-based messenger designed to uphold anonymity and champion freedom of speech for all users. By leveraging cutting-edge encryption technologies, we aim to provide a platform for secure, post-quantum communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our application utilizes the Kyber 1024 key exchange algorithm combined with AES-GCM encryption to ensure your conversations remain secure even against future quantum threats. To enhance privacy, 2EITRAM2 is exclusively available on the TOR browser, encouraging the use of VPNs for all connections.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to create a messenger so secure that even if subjected to legal raids, no party would be able to uncover the identities of users or the content of their messages. For added transparency, we are working to make our server logs publicly accessible in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Messages are never stored on our servers. Instead, they are saved locally on your device, encrypted after each session using AES-GCM with a key derived via PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations. This ensures that accessing your messages would require physical access to your device while it is actively connected to the application.
